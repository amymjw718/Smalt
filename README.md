Welcome to Smalt - A Spotify Music Alternative Listening Technology.

## Overview
***
Smalt is essentially a Web Application aimed to be used at parties by hosts, allowing guests to add songs to a playlist. Songs added to the playlist by the Guests of the party, will be queued based on the number of likes each song receives i.e. the songs at the top of the playlist would have received the highest number of likes. 


## Features
***
* Screen resolution - scales to size regardless of device whether it be a Smart Phone or Tablet.  
* Voting - Guest can Like a song based on their personal preferences.
* Hosts don't need to manually queue songs based on guests preferences - Smalt takes care of this. 
* Songs can be deleted from the playlist.
* Guests can request the same song to be played multiple times.
